# Bizarro Defilama Pools

This project is designed to compare the profitability and stability of liquidity pools available on [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/yields).

### Key Findings:
- The average APY across pools is around 2.5%, but there are instances where the APY spikes up to 50% before stabilizing back to around 2.5%. A notable example is the USDT pool on Aave.

- Some popular pools, such as the [USDC pool on Aave3](https://defillama.com/yields/pool/aa70268e-4b52-42bf-a116-608b370f9501), are becoming increasingly profitable over time.
